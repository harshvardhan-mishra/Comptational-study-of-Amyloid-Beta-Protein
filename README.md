Homology Modelling and Structure Analysis of Amyloid beta  protein
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impairs memory  and cognitive judgment. It is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life and is associated  with a significant social burden and increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Because  of mixed effectiveness of medications, exercise has been considered as a treatment for
pre-clinical AD, late stage AD, and as a prevention strategy. Exercise appears to improve  brain blood flow, increase hippocampal volume, and improve neurogenesis. Prospective  studies indicate that physical inactivity is one of the most common preventable risk factors for  developing AD and that higher physical activity levels are associated with a reduced risk of  development of disease. Exercise as a treatment for AD shows improvement in cognitive  function, decreased neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a slower decline in activities of daily  living (ADL). Exercise has been shown to have fewer side effects and better adherence  compared to medications.
